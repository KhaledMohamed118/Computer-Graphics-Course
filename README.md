## Assignment 1

**Problem :** Draw as much regular polygons as you can.

**Solution Idea :**

I supposed that there is a circle with radius 1 and its center at (0, 0), then the program will draw the regular ploygon inside it as each vertex of the polygon lie on the circumference of this circle.

The program will start with a blank screen, when you press a number key (from 3 to 9) on your keyboard it will draw a polygon its edges equal to the number you pressed and if you pressed a small character key on your keyboard it will draw a polygon its edges equal to the index of that character in the alphabet(indices are 0-based) + 10 ie. a = 10, b = 11, c = 12 and so on.
